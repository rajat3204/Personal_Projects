> **Project: VPC with Server in Private Subnet**

**Services Used:** VPC, NAT, ASG, ALB, Linux, IAM, EC2

**Description:** Designed and implemented a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both private and public subnets. Utilized Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to manage and scale EC2 instances. Configured a bastion host to securely access servers in the private subnet. Deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Integrated Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet.



> **Project: Infrastructure Deployment using Terraform**

**Tools Used:** Terraform

**Description:** Developed and managed AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Created a VPC with two private and two public subnets across different Availability Zones. Utilized the VPC module in the EC2 configuration to ensure instances launched within the specified VPC. Configured Elastic IP (EIP) and associated it with the EC2 instances. Automated the creation and download of key pairs to enable secure connection to the EC2 instances from a local machine.
