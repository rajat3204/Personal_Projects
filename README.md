> **Project: VPC with Server in Private Subnet**

**Services Used:** VPC, NAT, ASG, ALB, Linux, IAM, EC2

**Description:** Designed and implemented a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both private and public subnets. Utilized Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to manage and scale EC2 instances. Configured a bastion host to securely access servers in the private subnet. Deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Integrated Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet.
